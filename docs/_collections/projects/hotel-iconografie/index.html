<p>We had to design a set of icons for a
self-chosen theme. I chose a hotel building.</p>
<p>The name 'Focused', comes from the interrupted frame around each of the icons. Just like a camera that focuses on an object. Each icon is incorporated in the frame.</p>
<p>The icons were plotted on sticker-vinyl and applied on a forex plate.</p>
