<p>The scoutsgroup where I'm a leader myself needed a new website. The old one dated from ten years ago. The site was outdated in terms of both design and speed.</p>
<p>The old site used WordPress and was hosted on servers from Scoutnet, an organisations that scout groups to create an easy to maintain website.</p>
<p>The new version of the site uses a static site generator, Jekyll (Ruby based), but we're working on a new version in Eleventy. A newer type of static site generator, written in JavaScript. By using a JavaScript based generator we reduced the buildtime with at least 50 percent. Thereby making it (almost?) full-stack JavaScript.</p>
<p>To make shure that everyone can edit content we used Forestry.io as CMS. This gives us an user-friendly interface to edit all the content and it gave us the possibility to use an external host for all the media since Forestry can be coupled with Cloudinary.</p>
<p>The entire project is maintained on GitHub so when something is pushed, Netlify can automatically start a build.</p>
<p>We used Bootstrap as a base for the layout of the new site.</p>
