### My story

Let me introduce myself.

My name is Lennert and I'm a student Front-end-develoment at Artevelde University College Ghent.

I started my adventure in high school and followed a graphic education, after I graduated I continued this path in to College. During two years I got some lessons webdevelopment and was sold quickly. I loved the possibility to combine code and design and after two years I switched to Front-end-development.

My plan now? Probably work for a couple of years, become an independant webdeveloper and do a teacher training so I can become teacher in high school where I can share my passion with younger generations.

I like clean design, nice illustrations and stunning photography; With a lot of passion for the profession. You recognize my style by the generous use of white space, just enough letter spacing and a nice contrast that's created by combining fonts.

Nowadays I focus on webdesign & -development, but my passion for print is still there. Tactile, tangible, analog, as only one medium can. With a background in graphic design I try to combine code and design in the best possible way.

Some of my personal favorite projects:
- [Photo Sorter]({{ '/work/photo-sorter' | url})
- [Trivia quiz]({{ '/work/trivia-quiz' | url})
- [Tronald Dump]({{ '/work/trivia-quiz' | url})
